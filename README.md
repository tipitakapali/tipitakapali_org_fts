## Developer Notes  

If your given name is uPNRY, you should not be confused:

#### Roman Pali Chapter Files  
- The **Electron and Flutter apps** include `<div>` elements for **Ctrl + F** search, while the **web files** do not.  
- Files hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** include the `<meta property="og:url" content="...">` tag but do **not** have a `.html` file extension.  

Despite these structural differences, the **FTS of CST content remains the same** across all versions.
